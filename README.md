##ATTENTION NSS COHORT 9

Each of you only needs to do one thing! Go into the folder labeled _students.

There is a template in there and several examples. Fork the repo. Make a file for yourself. Make a pull request. Do it now. They need to be done before you go to bed tonight. Tomorrow I will put your pictures in. For now just put nothing or copy one of the example picture paths.
